## 📌 Project Overview

This deep learning project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automatically detect **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images. Built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed with **Streamlit**, this model distinguishes between:
- ✅ `NORMAL` (Healthy lungs)
- ❌ `PNEUMONIA` (Infected lungs)

---

## 🎯 Features

- Upload a chest X-ray and get real-time prediction
- Clean and simple **Streamlit UI**
- CNN trained on **Kaggle Pneumonia dataset**
- Easy to run locally or deploy on the web
